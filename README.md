# uk-electoral-commission-apis

The
[UK's Electoral Commission's Election Information API v1](https://api.electoralcommission.org.uk/docs/)
provides a way to access information about future elections for a postcode unit
and/or address. This library package provides bindings in Haskell to that API.

This package has no connection with the UK's Electoral Commission or its
affiliates.
